-- PLANNED: the thorough alt 4 route for Troll Hunter: tools/route_planner.py troll --preset all --install --quiet (docs/PLANNER.md)
-- Do not edit by hand: the next install replaces it. Change the route with tools/route_planner.py.
-- Built on the data pack: QuestieDB's Classic-era baseline plus its Forever layers (new quests, zones, class chains). The layers give IDs, levels and races, not complete objectives or restrictions: docs/FOREVER-API-NOTES.md.
